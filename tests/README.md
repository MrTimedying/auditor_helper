# Auditor Helper - Test Suite

This directory contains test files for the Auditor Helper application. These files are **excluded from production builds** and are only used for development and testing purposes.

## Test Files

### Core Functionality Tests
- `test_imports.py` - Tests import functionality and module dependencies
- `test_pool.py` - Tests thread pool functionality
- `test_virtual_model.py` - Tests virtual model implementation
- `comprehensive_boundary_test.py` - Tests week boundary calculations

### Performance and Optimization Tests
- `test_resize_diagnostics.py` - Tests Phase 1 diagnostic system
- `test_phase2_optimization.py` - Interactive test for Phase 2 optimization system
- `performance_tests.py` - Comprehensive performance testing suite

## Running Tests

### Individual Tests
```bash
# Run from project root
python tests/test_imports.py
python tests/test_pool.py
python tests/test_virtual_model.py
```

### Interactive Tests
```bash
# Phase 2 optimization testing (opens GUI)

## Important Notes

- **Production Exclusion**: All files in this directory are excluded from production builds via `.gitignore`
- **Development Only**: These tests are for development and validation purposes only
- **Dependencies**: Some tests may require additional development dependencies not included in production builds
- **Data Generation**: Tests may generate temporary data files that are automatically excluded from git

## Test Data

Any test data generated by these tests is automatically excluded from version control and production builds through the `.gitignore` configuration:

- `metrics_data/` - Performance metrics and diagnostic data
- `test_data/` - Generated test datasets
- `performance_data/` - Performance test results
- `diagnostic_data/` - Diagnostic system outputs

## Development Guidelines

When adding new tests:
1. Place them in this `tests/` directory
2. Use descriptive filenames starting with `test_`
3. Include proper documentation and comments
4. Ensure tests don't interfere with production functionality
5. Add any generated data directories to `.gitignore` if needed
