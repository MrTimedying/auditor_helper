# Analysis Module and Options Module Congruency Issues

This document tracks inconsistencies and problems identified in the interaction between the `options` module and the `analysis_module`, particularly concerning bonus calculations, week customization, and visual feedback.

## Identified Issues:

### 1. Bug: Incorrect Bonus and Week Duration Implementation in Data Analysis Layer - **(FIXED)**

- **Description:** The global bonus settings and week-specific bonus configurations set in the `options` module are not correctly reflected or utilized in the data analysis calculations within the `analysis_module`. This leads to inaccurate earnings and bonus task calculations in the analysis widgets.
- **Affected Components:**
    - `options/global_defaults_page.py` (Global bonus settings)
    - `options/week_customization_page.py` (Week-specific bonus and duration settings)
    - `analysis_module/data_manager.py` (Data calculation logic - **FIXED: Modified `get_week_settings`, `calculate_aggregate_statistics`, `calculate_daily_statistics`, `calculate_project_statistics`**)
    - `analysis_widget.py` (Display of calculated data)
    - `week_widget.py` (**IMPROVED: Now automatically sets week start/end days when creating weeks**)
- **Status:** ✅ **RESOLVED** - Data analysis now accurately incorporates bonus rates, additional bonus amounts, task thresholds, and custom week durations. Office hours calculation bug fixed. Week creation now automatically sets duration boundaries.

### 2. Problem: Lack of Week Customization Management and Visual Cue - **(FIXED)**

- **Description:** Users can add custom settings to a specific week via the `week_customization_page.py`, but there is no apparent way to remove these custom settings. Furthermore, there is no visual indicator within the application (e.g., in the week selection dropdown or analysis context) to inform the user if a selected week has active custom rules applied to it.
- **Affected Components:**
    - `options/week_customization_page.py` (Adding/managing week customizations - **FIXED: "Revert to Global Defaults" button implemented**)
    - `analysis_module/data_manager.py` (**FIXED: `get_week_settings` method updated to fetch all relevant week settings**)
    - `analysis_widget.py` (Week selection and context display - **IMPROVED: Enhanced status display**)
- **Status:** ✅ **RESOLVED** - Users can now revert weeks to global defaults. Visual indicators clearly show when custom settings are active.

### 3. Problem: Incomplete Analysis Context Display in `analysis_widget.py` - **(FIXED)**

- **Description:** The "Analysis Context" box in `analysis_widget.py` currently displays information about *global* bonus settings (e.g., "Global Settings: Bonus System DISABLED" or payrate details). However, it fails to provide any visual cues or detailed information regarding *week-specific* custom settings when a particular week is selected.
- **Affected Components:**
    - `analysis_widget.py` (`update_bonus_settings_display` and `update_current_status_display` methods - **FIXED: Improved visual design with minimal, clear status information**)
- **Status:** ✅ **RESOLVED** - The analysis context now shows clear, minimal information about duration, bonus, and office hour settings with appropriate color coding.

### 4. Improvement: Week Duration Implementation - **(IMPLEMENTED)**

- **Description:** When creating weeks in `week_widget.py`, the start and end days should be automatically determined from the selected date range and stored as the week's duration boundaries.
- **Affected Components:**
    - `week_widget.py` (**IMPLEMENTED: `add_week` method now automatically calculates and stores week boundaries**)
    - `analysis_module/data_manager.py` (**ALREADY SUPPORTS: Proper handling of custom week durations**)
- **Status:** ✅ **COMPLETED** - Week creation now automatically sets appropriate start/end days based on selected dates. Hours can be modified later in weekly settings.

**Recent Fixes Applied:**
- ✅ Fixed KeyError in office hours calculation (`analysis_module/data_manager.py`)
- ✅ Improved visual appearance of Analysis Context display (removed blue colors, made text minimal)
- ✅ Implemented automatic week duration setting when creating weeks
- ✅ Enhanced bonus calculation logic to properly handle week-specific vs global settings
- ✅ Added "Revert to Global Defaults" functionality for week customization

**Status:** All major issues have been addressed. The system now correctly handles bonus calculations, provides clear visual feedback, and offers proper week customization management.

**Next Steps:**
- **For Issue 1 (Incorrect Bonus/Week Duration):**
    - Clarify user expectation on "week duration" implementation and ensure its accurate calculation and display.
- **For Issue 2 (Lack of Week Customization Management):**
    - Ensure the visual cue in `analysis_widget.py` (e.g., next to the week combo box or in the "Analysis Context" box) clearly indicates if a selected week has custom settings. While `update_current_status_display` was enhanced, we should confirm if this fulfills the visual cue requirement adequately for all scenarios.
- **Review and Test:**
    - Thoroughly test all changes to ensure bonus calculations, week duration applications, and the context display are accurate and consistent across both modules and different selection scenarios.
