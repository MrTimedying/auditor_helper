## v0.17.7-hotfix (Emergency Release) - 2024-12-19

### 🚨 CRITICAL EMERGENCY FIXES
**ISSUE**: Phase 2 optimization system entered recursive paint loop causing paint frequencies to spike from 238Hz to over 1100Hz, making the application unusable.

**ROOT CAUSE**: The optimization system was triggering during paint events, causing modifications that triggered more paint events in an infinite loop.

**EMERGENCY FIXES IMPLEMENTED**:

1. **Circuit Breaker System**:
   - Added `_optimization_in_progress` flag to prevent recursive optimization calls
   - Added `_emergency_shutdown` flag for extreme frequency scenarios (500Hz+)
   - Added paint frequency history tracking to detect escalating patterns

2. **Deferred Optimization Activation**:
   - Used `QTimer.singleShot(0, ...)` to defer optimization until after paint events complete
   - Prevents optimization from interfering with Qt's paint system

3. **Emergency Shutdown Mechanism**:
   - Automatic shutdown when paint frequency exceeds 500Hz
   - Pattern detection for escalating frequencies (sign of recursive loops)
   - System-wide fallback to ensure functionality is preserved

4. **Method Signature Fixes**:
   - Fixed missing `get_current_time()` method calls (replaced with `time.time()`)
   - Fixed `_trigger_fallback()` signature mismatch in ResizeStateManager
   - Fixed import issues with TaskGridDiagnostics class name

5. **Enhanced Error Handling**:
   - Added comprehensive try/catch blocks around all optimization operations
   - Graceful fallback mechanisms that preserve TaskGrid functionality
   - Emergency state reset capability for recovery

**VALIDATION**: Emergency test suite confirms all fixes working correctly:
- ✅ System initializes without errors
- ✅ Moderate frequencies (100Hz) handled without recursion
- ✅ Extreme frequencies (600Hz) trigger emergency shutdown
- ✅ Circuit breaker prevents recursive calls
- ✅ Cleanup works properly

**IMPACT**: 
- **BEFORE**: Application unusable due to 1000Hz+ paint loops, recursive repaint errors, Qt paint engine corruption
- **AFTER**: Application stable, optimization system safely disabled during extreme scenarios, full functionality preserved

**SAFETY**: All emergency fixes maintain zero functional impact - if optimization fails, the system gracefully falls back to normal operation.

    - **Statistical Analysis Module**: Introduced `analysis_module/statistical_analysis.py` with capabilities for linear regression and correlation calculations, forming the basis for advanced statistical overlays.
    - **Improved Line Series Styling**: Enhanced line chart visibility with slightly thicker lines (2px) and proper application of semantic colors.
    - **Modular Architecture**: Further refined the separation of concerns by introducing dedicated modules for statistical analysis and chart interactions, improving maintainability.

## v0.16.24-beta
- **TaskGrid UI Virtualization for Performance:**
    - **Complete Architecture Refactor**: Migrated TaskGrid from `QTableWidget` to `QTableView` with custom `QAbstractTableModel` implementation to enable UI virtualization for improved performance with large datasets.
    - **New TaskTableModel Class**: Implemented comprehensive model class that handles data management, cell editing, checkbox states, and custom highlighting while supporting virtualization.
    - **Performance Improvements**: 
        - **Smooth Resizing**: Eliminated lag during window resizing by reducing the number of UI elements rendered simultaneously
        - **Efficient Scrolling**: Only visible rows are rendered, improving responsiveness with large task lists
        - **Reduced Memory Usage**: Lower memory footprint for applications with many tasks
    - **Enhanced Red Border Highlighting**: Fixed and improved the visual highlighting system for empty and initialization value cells (00:00:00 duration/time_limit, score of 0) - red borders with glow effect now display correctly.
    - **Preserved Functionality**: All existing features maintained including:
        - Cell editing for most columns with validation
        - Timer dialog integration for duration column
        - Feedback dialog for feedback column
        - Checkbox selection with task deletion
        - Database update operations and analysis refresh
        - Task boundary validation and office hour management
    - **Model-View Architecture**: Proper separation of data (TaskTableModel) and presentation (TaskGrid view) following Qt best practices for maintainability and extensibility.
    - **Delegate System**: Updated TaskGridItemDelegate to work with the new model system while preserving custom cell painting for highlighted cells.

## v0.16.23-beta
- **Precise Bonus and Boundary Validation:**
    - **Dual Timestamp Bonus Eligibility**: The `is_task_eligible_for_bonus()` method in `analysis_module/data_manager.py` was completely rewritten to ensure **BOTH** `time_begin` AND `time_end` of a task fall within the defined bonus window. This provides accurate bonus calculation based on the actual duration of the task.
    - **Corrected Day Indexing**: Fixed the conversion of bonus start/end days from the global settings format (1=Monday, 7=Sunday) to Python's `datetime.weekday()` format (0=Monday, 6=Sunday), resolving issues with wrap-around bonus periods (e.g., Friday PM to Monday AM).
    - **Comprehensive Boundary Validation**: The `validate_task_against_boundaries()` method in `task_grid.py` was enhanced to check if **BOTH** `time_begin` AND `time_end` (if available) fall within the selected week's boundaries. This ensures tasks are correctly validated against the week's duration, with intelligent fallbacks to `date_audited` if precise timestamps are missing.
    - **Improved User Feedback**: Boundary validation now provides more specific warnings to the user, indicating whether the start time, end time, or both fall outside the week boundaries.
    - **Thorough Testing**: Implemented a dedicated test script (`test_bonus_logic.py`) to rigorously verify all aspects of the new bonus eligibility logic, including edge cases, wrap-around periods, and partial overlaps, with all tests passing. The test script was removed after successful verification.

## v0.16.22-beta
- **Collapsible Week Sidebar - Integrated Toggle Button:**
    - **Enhanced UI Integration:** The "Hide Weeks" button has been moved from the main window's top bar directly into the `CollapsibleWeekSidebar` itself, providing a more intuitive and modern user experience.
    - **`main.py` Updates:** The old `toggle_week_sidebar_btn` and its associated logic were removed from `main.py`.
    - **`collapsible_week_sidebar.py` Updates:**
        - Introduced an `expand_collapse_button` within the sidebar, which is visible when the sidebar is expanded (showing "⬅️ Hide Weeks").
        - The `toggle()` method within `CollapsibleWeekSidebar` now correctly manages the visibility of both the `collapse_button` (when collapsed, showing "Weeks") and the new `expand_collapse_button` (when expanded).
        - Adjusted styling and layout within `CollapsibleWeekSidebar` to accommodate the new button and ensure smooth transitions during collapse/expand animations.
    - **User Experience:** Provides a visually appealing and intuitive collapsible week sidebar, allowing users to maximize screen space while keeping week selection accessible.

## v0.16.21-beta
- **Modern Collapsible Week Sidebar:**
    - **Overhauled Week Sidebar UI:** Replaced the previous `QDockWidget`-based week sidebar with a new, custom `CollapsibleWeekSidebar` widget for a modern, animated, and more controlled user experience.
    - **New Component:** Introduced `collapsible_week_sidebar.py` which is a `QWidget` responsible for: 
        - Encapsulating the `WeekWidget`.
        - Managing the sidebar's collapsed (slim bar with "Weeks" text) and expanded (full `WeekWidget`) states.
        - Implementing smooth expand/collapse animations using `QPropertyAnimation`.
        - Handling its own internal `toggle` logic and state.
    - **`main.py` Updates:**
        - Removed `self.week_dock` and all related `QDockWidget` properties, animations, and menu actions.
        - Integrated the new `CollapsibleWeekSidebar` directly into the `QMainWindow`'s central layout, placing it alongside the `task_grid` area.
        - Updated the `toggle_week_sidebar` method to directly control the `CollapsibleWeekSidebar`'s `toggle` state, removing the old animation logic.
        - Ensured `WeekWidget` correctly receives the `main_window` reference via the `CollapsibleWeekSidebar` for seamless access to `toaster_manager` and `analysis_widget`.
        - Removed the obsolete `_on_animation_finished` method.
    - **`week_widget.py` Adjustments:**
        - Removed `self.setWindowTitle` and `self.setWindowFlags` as `WeekWidget` is no longer a top-level window.
        - Removed the internal `get_dark_stylesheet` method, delegating styling entirely to the global `ThemeManager`.
    - **User Experience:** Provides a visually appealing and intuitive collapsible week sidebar, allowing users to maximize screen space while keeping week selection accessible.

## v0.16.20-beta
- **Office Hours Feature Overhaul:**
    - **Separation from Tasks:** Office hours are now completely independent of task data, preventing skewing of task counts and analysis.
    - **Database Schema Update:** Added `office_hour_count`, `office_hour_payrate`, `office_hour_session_duration_minutes`, and `use_global_office_hours_settings` columns to the `weeks` table.
    - **Global Settings Integration:** New `office_hours_settings` key in `global_settings.py` for default payrate and session duration.
    - **Options Dialog UI Enhancements:**
        - **Global Defaults Page:** Added controls for setting global default office hour payrate and session duration.
        - **Week Customization Page:** Implemented week-specific office hour settings with a toggle to use global defaults and input fields for custom payrate and duration. The session duration spinbox was updated to `QDoubleSpinBox` for consistency.
    - **Main UI Improvements (`main.py`, `task_grid.py`):**
        - **Revamped Controls:** Replaced the old "Add Office Hours" button with minimalist "+" and "-" buttons for adding/removing office hour sessions.
        - **Dedicated Display:** A label now shows the current office hour count for the selected week.
        - **Button Reorganization:** Semantic grouping of buttons in `main.py`
            - Task actions (Add New Task, Delete Rows) are on the left.
            - Office Hours controls and Bonus Toggle are grouped on the right, separated by a stretch.
        - **Bonus Toggle Text & Styling:** Changed "Bonus: ON/OFF" to "Global: ON/OFF" and updated colors for consistency with the application's theme (blue for ON, grey for OFF/DISABLED).
    - **Analysis Module Integration (`analysis_module/data_manager.py`):**
        - **Accurate Earnings Calculation:** Office hour earnings are now correctly included in `total_earnings` for both aggregate and daily statistics, while strictly excluded from task-specific metrics.
        - **Robust Data Retrieval:** `get_week_office_hours_data` method correctly handles global fallback and NULL values.
    - **Critical Bug Fix:** Resolved "tuple index out of range" errors in `analysis_module/data_manager.py`'s statistics calculation methods by correcting incorrect tuple indexing (e.g., `task[0]` for duration instead of `task[2]`). This ensures data is accessed correctly after the removal of the `bonus_paid`
