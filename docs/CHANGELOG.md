## v0.17.7-hotfix (Emergency Release) - 2024-12-19

### üö® CRITICAL EMERGENCY FIXES
**ISSUE**: Phase 2 optimization system entered recursive paint loop causing paint frequencies to spike from 238Hz to over 1100Hz, making the application unusable.

**ROOT CAUSE**: The optimization system was triggering during paint events, causing modifications that triggered more paint events in an infinite loop.

**EMERGENCY FIXES IMPLEMENTED**:

1. **Circuit Breaker System**:
   - Added `_optimization_in_progress` flag to prevent recursive optimization calls
   - Added `_emergency_shutdown` flag for extreme frequency scenarios (500Hz+)
   - Added paint frequency history tracking to detect escalating patterns

2. **Deferred Optimization Activation**:
   - Used `QTimer.singleShot(0, ...)` to defer optimization until after paint events complete
   - Prevents optimization from interfering with Qt's paint system

3. **Emergency Shutdown Mechanism**:
   - Automatic shutdown when paint frequency exceeds 500Hz
   - Pattern detection for escalating frequencies (sign of recursive loops)
   - System-wide fallback to ensure functionality is preserved

4. **Method Signature Fixes**:
   - Fixed missing `get_current_time()` method calls (replaced with `time.time()`)
   - Fixed `_trigger_fallback()` signature mismatch in ResizeStateManager
   - Fixed import issues with TaskGridDiagnostics class name

5. **Enhanced Error Handling**:
   - Added comprehensive try/catch blocks around all optimization operations
   - Graceful fallback mechanisms that preserve TaskGrid functionality
   - Emergency state reset capability for recovery

**VALIDATION**: Emergency test suite confirms all fixes working correctly:
- ‚úÖ System initializes without errors
- ‚úÖ Moderate frequencies (100Hz) handled without recursion
- ‚úÖ Extreme frequencies (600Hz) trigger emergency shutdown
- ‚úÖ Circuit breaker prevents recursive calls
- ‚úÖ Cleanup works properly

**IMPACT**: 
- **BEFORE**: Application unusable due to 1000Hz+ paint loops, recursive repaint errors, Qt paint engine corruption
- **AFTER**: Application stable, optimization system safely disabled during extreme scenarios, full functionality preserved

**SAFETY**: All emergency fixes maintain zero functional impact - if optimization fails, the system gracefully falls back to normal operation.
